    1. Discussion and planning, where we define the business goals of the project. 
    2. Design, where I create a prototype in Figma/Framer if you don't have a ready-made design. 
    3. Development, where I write the code, regularly providing you with access to a demo version. 
    4. Testing and launch, after which I hand over a fully functional project to you.`
